##  **DoorDash Delivery and Revenue Optimization**  

##  **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing **DoorDash delivery data** to extract meaningful insights regarding **dashers (delivery personnel), order deliveries, and revenue trends** across various markets. I performed **data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and in-depth analysis** to uncover patterns in **delivery times, order volumes, market performance, and customer behavior.**  

## **Problem Statement**  

Food delivery services face challenges in optimizing delivery efficiency, managing dasher workloads, and improving customer satisfaction. High-demand periods lead to delays, inefficient resource allocation, and suboptimal revenue performance. This project aims to analyze delivery performance, order trends, and revenue contributions to identify key bottlenecks and provide data-driven recommendations for enhancing operational efficiency and maximizing profitability.

##  **Data Exploration & Initial Analysis**  
- **Retrieving all data** from the `DoorDash` table for initial inspection.  
- **Describing the table structure**, checking column data types, and understanding the dataset.  
- **Identifying unique categories** in `store_primary_category`.  
- **Handling missing values** by identifying NULL categories.  
- **Grouping stores by category** to analyze the distribution of stores.  

##  **Data Cleaning**  
- **Removing unwanted data**, such as eliminating stores categorized as `chocolate`.  
- **Checking for missing values** in critical columns (`market_id`, `store_id`, `order_protocol`, etc.).  

##  **Data Transformation**  
- **Creating new columns**, including `city_name`, `subtotal_in_dollars`, `order_created_day_name`, etc.  
- **Modifying column data types** (`actual_date`, `created_date`, `created_time`, `actual_time`).  
- **Updating columns with calculated values**, such as converting `subtotal` from cents to dollars.  

##  **Price & Duration Updates**  
- **Converting prices** from cents to dollars (`min_item_price`, `max_item_price`).  
- **Updating delivery durations**, converting seconds to minutes (`estimated_order_place_duration_in_minutes`).  
- **Calculating total estimated delivery duration** by summing various time components.  

##  **Categorization & Classification**  
- **Peak vs Off-Peak categorization** (`Peak_Hour` column).  
- **Item price segmentation** into 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' price categories.  
- **Time of day classification** (`Morning`, `Afternoon`, `Evening`, `Night`).  

##  **Column Removal & Adjustments**  
- **Dropping unnecessary columns**, such as `Item_Volume_Category`.  
- **Handling division by zero** when calculating `revenue_per_item`.  

##  **Revenue & Performance Analysis**  
- **Daily & hourly revenue trends** to analyze peak revenue periods.  
- **Impact of delivery time on revenue** based on time-of-day analysis.  
- **Performance metrics analysis**, including dasher load factor, delivery duration, and outstanding orders.
- **Market contribution to total revenue** (highest and lowest-performing regions).  
- **Cuisines generating the most revenue** and their popularity by order volume.
- **Item pricing analysis** by cuisine category.  

##  **Dasher Insights & Analysis**  
- **Dasher workload analysis** across different markets.  
- **Impact of outstanding orders on delivery time** to determine bottlenecks.  
- **Utilization patterns**, identifying when dasher usage exceeds 80%.  
- **Idle dasher impact** on overall delivery performance.  
- **Order density per dasher** and peak-time order handling efficiency.

- **Localize Menus**: Tailor food offerings based on regional preferences (e.g., Japanese, Indian, or local specialties) to enhance customer satisfaction.  
- **Seasonal Menus**: Launch limited-time or holiday-themed menu items to boost engagement and sales during specific seasons.  

###  High-Value Orders & Delivery Efficiency  
- **Prioritize High-Value Orders**: Ensure that orders above $50 receive faster processing and delivery during peak hours.  
- **Accurate Time Estimates**: Provide better estimated delivery times for premium orders, ensuring efficient resource allocation.  
- **Premium Delivery Option**: Introduce an optional **"Priority Delivery"** service for customers willing to pay extra for guaranteed faster delivery.  

###  Time Optimization & Order Volume Management  
- **Optimize Peak Hour Resources**: Utilize predictive models to dynamically adjust dasher availability and restaurant staff levels.
