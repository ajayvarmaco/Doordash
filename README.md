##  **Data Exploration & Initial Analysis**  
- **Retrieving all data** from the `DoorDash` table for initial inspection.  
- **Describing the table structure**, checking column data types, and understanding the dataset.  
- **Identifying unique categories** in `store_primary_category`.  
- **Handling missing values** by identifying NULL categories.  
- **Grouping stores by category** to analyze the distribution of stores.  

##  **Data Cleaning**  
- **Removing unwanted data**, such as eliminating stores categorized as `chocolate`.  
- **Checking for missing values** in critical columns (`market_id`, `store_id`, `order_protocol`, etc.).  

##  **Data Transformation**  
- **Creating new columns**, including `city_name`, `subtotal_in_dollars`, `order_created_day_name`, etc.  
- **Modifying column data types** (`actual_date`, `created_date`, `created_time`, `actual_time`).  
- **Updating columns with calculated values**, such as converting `subtotal` from cents to dollars.  

##  **Price & Duration Updates**  
- **Converting prices** from cents to dollars (`min_item_price`, `max_item_price`).  
- **Updating delivery durations**, converting seconds to minutes (`estimated_order_place_duration_in_minutes`).  
- **Calculating total estimated delivery duration** by summing various time components.  

##  **Categorization & Classification**  
- **Peak vs Off-Peak categorization** (`Peak_Hour` column).  
- **Item price segmentation** into 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' price categories.  
- **Time of day classification** (`Morning`, `Afternoon`, `Evening`, `Night`).  

##  **Column Removal & Adjustments**  
- **Dropping unnecessary columns**, such as `Item_Volume_Category`.  
- **Handling division by zero** when calculating `revenue_per_item`.  

##  **Revenue & Performance Analysis**  
- **Daily & hourly revenue trends** to analyze peak revenue periods.  
- **Impact of delivery time on revenue** based on time-of-day analysis.  
- **Performance metrics analysis**, including dasher load factor, delivery duration, and outstanding orders.
- **Market contribution to total revenue** (highest and lowest-performing regions).  
- **Cuisines generating the most revenue** and their popularity by order volume.
- **Item pricing analysis** by cuisine category.  
 

##  **Dasher Insights & Analysis**  
- **Dasher workload analysis** across different markets.  
- **Impact of outstanding orders on delivery time** to determine bottlenecks.  
- **Utilization patterns**, identifying when dasher usage exceeds 80%.  
- **Idle dasher impact** on overall delivery performance.  
- **Order density per dasher** and peak-time order handling efficiency.  

##  **Delivery Insights & Analysis**  
- **Market-level analysis** of average delivery times.  
- **Comparing actual vs estimated delivery times** across all orders.  
- **Late delivery patterns** and peak-hour delays by market.  
- **Peak hours for orders**, identifying the busiest periods.
- **High-value order delivery trends**, analyzing if premium orders are delivered faster.

##  **Comparisons & Advanced Analysis**  
- **Dasher load vs actual delivery times**, identifying bottlenecks.  
- **Market performance comparisons** based on KPIs.  
- **Predicted vs actual delivery time analysis**, evaluating estimation accuracy.  
- **Factors influencing late deliveries**, including order size and dasher availability.  
- **Top markets and cuisines** ranked by revenue, order volume, and efficiency.  
- **Fastest delivery time windows**, identifying optimal delivery periods.

##  Key Findings & Business Recommendations  

###  Dasher Workload & Delivery Performance  
- **Optimize Load Distribution**: Increase dasher availability during peak hours (18:00, 20:00, 22:00) to reduce delays and improve order fulfillment.  
- **Peak Hour Incentives**: Introduce bonuses for dashers during high-demand periods to ensure adequate coverage.  

###  Delivery Efficiency & Timeliness  
- **Enhance Time Estimates**: Improve delivery time predictions by integrating real-time traffic, weather, and location data.  
- **Predictive Analytics**: Leverage AI to forecast demand spikes and dynamically allocate resources to reduce delays.  
- **Buffer Times**: Implement controlled buffer times during peak hours to better manage delays and set realistic customer expectations.  

### üçΩÔ∏è Cuisine Popularity & Product Offering  
- **Expand High-Performing Cuisines**: Introduce exclusive or premium versions of top-selling cuisines (e.g., Pizza, Mexican, American) to increase customer spend.  
- **Localize Menus**: Tailor food offerings based on regional preferences (e.g., Japanese, Indian, or local specialties) to enhance customer satisfaction.  
- **Seasonal Menus**: Launch limited-time or holiday-themed menu items to boost engagement and sales during specific seasons.  

###  High-Value Orders & Delivery Efficiency  
- **Prioritize High-Value Orders**: Ensure that orders above $50 receive faster processing and delivery during peak hours.  
- **Accurate Time Estimates**: Provide better estimated delivery times for premium orders, ensuring efficient resource allocation.  
- **Premium Delivery Option**: Introduce an optional **"Priority Delivery"** service for customers willing to pay extra for guaranteed faster delivery.  

###  Time Optimization & Order Volume Management  
- **Optimize Peak Hour Resources**: Utilize predictive models to dynamically adjust dasher availability and restaurant staff levels.  
- **Promote Off-Peak Ordering**: Offer discounts or incentives for orders placed during off-peak hours to balance demand.  
- **Flexible Delivery Windows**: Provide customers with multiple delivery window options to improve satisfaction and reduce peak-hour congestion.
